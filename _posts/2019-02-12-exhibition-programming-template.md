This will be the premier exhibition of artists books from world renowned book artists Islam Aly, Maureen Cummins, Erik Ruin, Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist that weave archival research of refugee and migrant experiences with contemporary Syrian and Iraqi narratives of resettlement to Philadelphia. Their works will be exhibited alongside the works made by Syrian and Iraqi project collaborators that were produced throughout a series of workshops led by the project artists, as well as co-created works with artists Maryan Captan, Joshua Graupera, Eric Battle. The original artwork will be accompanied by archival materials related to displacement from Swarthmore College’s Friends Historical Library and Peace Collection.

Experience the exhibition with an opening walkthrough with Artistic Director, Suzanne Seesman. It will be followed by a communal dinner, catered by Aria Mediterranean Cuisineto meet all collaborators, commissioned artists, and project team members who made this project possible.Expect delicious food and stimulating conversation as we continue to build community together.

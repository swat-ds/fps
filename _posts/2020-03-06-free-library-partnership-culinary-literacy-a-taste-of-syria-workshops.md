##The Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary project was lucky to collaborate with the [Free Library of Philadelphia Culinary Literacy Center](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/programs/culinary/) to organize a series of 3 workshops called a Taste of Syria. The partnership supported a fourth cooking workshop during the [_Peace_ Open House and Reception](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/public%20events/exhibition%20programming/exhibit:free%20library/peace-open-house-and-reception/) at the [Parkway Central Free Library](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/locations/parkway-central-library) in Summer 2019.

## **[Osama Herkal: Molokheya & Fattoush](https://www.facebook.com/events/310161473069864/)**

September 17, 2018, Parkway Central Free Library Kitchen

> Osama taught a class on how to make Syrian molokheya, fattoush, and rice with sha3reya (vermicelli) at the [Free Library of Philadelphia Culinary Literacy Center](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/programs/culinary/). Since coming to the US, he has substituted tortilla in the place of pita bread to make the "croutons" for the fattoush. Without doubt it was delicious and there was more than plenty of food to go around for each person to take a plate to go too! Each person got to take home a beautiful recipe page designed by Artistic Director, Suzanne Seesman. Osama was reunited with a piece of home when he was presented with a fresh molokheya plant from Owen Taylor of [True Love Seeds](https://trueloveseeds.com/). Osama gave the plant a huge bear hug. These seeds originated in Syria, making their way through Egypt and eventually to the US - a similar path that Osama and his family took to get here.

> Asmaa Diab led this hands on workshop at Parkway Central Library's Culinary Center teaching how to make kibbe and tabouleh. She was accompanied by her husband Hassan and two other project collaborators Amaal and Fadia. One participant said kibbe reminded her of a type of food she grew up with in Germany and another in Romania. Asmaa brought to life her stories of making food with relatives and friends throughout this workshop. A truly communal environment was created as everyone rolled the kibbe in their hands. Asmaa continues to cater and offer cooking workshops.

title: 'Where the Lines of Our Hands Meet from Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist '
---
***Where the Lines of Our Hands Meet*** artist book from [Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist](http://peoplespaperco-op.weebly.com/) was collaborative and transformational from process to product.

This book is more than handmade paper and powerful artwork. It is the culmination of laughter and frustration, of honest conversation, of shared meals, and of hugs. It was created by an amazing group of individuals in resettlement from Syria and Iraq, living in Philadelphia over the course of several months in 2018.

The paper itself is as important as the words and images atop it. The book is comprised of handmade paper made that was created from negative news articles about migrants and refugees, which project collaborators wrote on top of with their own negative experiences based on stereotypes. In a group, each person read their experience outloud, tore up the paper, and transformed it into new sheets of blank handmade paper. The collectively written poem (presented in English and Arabic) weaves responses to such prompts as 

<br/>مدينتي والعراقيات بالذات فحالات الانفصال باتت على 
<br/>قدم وساق ....وبعض السيدات تركن أزواجهن واولادهن في 
<br/>العراق وجئن لوحدهن....اتق الله ايتها العراقية فبيتك
<br/>هو جنتك وزوجك واولادك هم زينة حياتك وملاذك الأمن
<br/>أرجوا أن يكون كلامي هذا له صدى ويكون له أثر في تلك 
<br/>النفوس ... 
<br/>والله الموفق مع تحياتي 
{: .ar}

May peace and God’s blessings and mercy be upon you,
<br/>May your times be blessed with all that’s good
<br/>They say that a woman is half the society, but I say she’s all of it

was a collaborative effort led by [Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist](http://peoplespaperco-op.weebly.com/) in collaboration with Abdul Karim Awad, Abir AlArnab, Asmaa Diab, Fadaa Ali, Fouad Sakhnini, Layla Al Hussein, Marwa, Mohamed Okab, Osama Herkal, Raghad Samir, Roula Al-Jabi, their families, and multiple other people who wish to remain anonymous.

> Through sharing past obstacles and difficult experiences, while also renewing future dreams in a new place through artmaking, this guide was collaboratively made to extend an added hand of support - carrying forward the timelines of compassion, shared destiny, and spaces of sanctuary.

The resource guide was co-created to distribut to partnering organizations Nationalities Services Center and HIAS, along with other resettlement agencies and social service providers. View the entire [Resource Guide here](/assets/Resource Guide M+C.pdf). If you or someone you know works with refugees, feel free to reprint the guide for distribution and let us know!

Large banners were made out of images found in the resource guide highlighting skills and passions that could strengthen community, along with a glossary of words to help newcomers thrive. They were exhibited along with the resource on the [4th Floor of the Philadelphia City Hall](https://creativephl.org/). The bannners and resource guide were also exhibited at [Booklyn](http://booklyn.org/).

The poem below was created by weaving project collaborators' responses to a variety of prompts and is the centerfold of the resource guide.

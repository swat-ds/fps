***Where the Lines of Our Hands Meet: Resource Guide*** was a collaborative effort led by [Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist](http://peoplespaperco-op.weebly.com/) in collaboration with Abdul Karim Awad, Abir AlArnab, Asmaa Diab, Fadaa Ali, Fouad Sakhnini, Layla Al Hussein, Marwa, Mohamed Okab, Osama Herkal, Raghad Samir, Roula Al-Jabi, their families, and multiple other people who wish to remain anonymous. Guide translations provided by Tamim Arabi, Yaroub Al-Obaidi, and [Nationalities Services Center](https://nscphila.org/). Poem translation provided by Dana Beseiso with edits from Adam Amin. Graphic Design by [Jason Killinger](https://jasonkillinger.com/).

> Through sharing past obstacles and difficult experiences, while also renewing future dreams in a new place through artmaking, this guide was collaboratively made to extend an added hand of support - carrying forward the timelines of compassion, shared destiny, and spaces of sanctuary.

**The resource guide was co-created to distribut to partnering organizations Nationalities Services Center and HIAS, along with other resettlement agencies and social service providers. View and download the entire [Resource Guide here](/assets/Resource Guide M+C.pdf). If you or someone you know works with refugees, feel free to reprint the guide for distribution and let us know!**

Large banners were made out of images found in the resource guide highlighting skills and passions that could strengthen community, along with a glossary of words to help newcomers thrive. They were exhibited along with the resource on the [4th Floor of the Philadelphia City Hall](https://creativephl.org/). The bannners and resource guide were also exhibited at [Booklyn](http://booklyn.org/).

The poem below was created by weaving project collaborators' responses to a variety of prompts and is the centerfold of the resource guide.

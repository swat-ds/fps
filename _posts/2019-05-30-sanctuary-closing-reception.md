The closing celebration will activate the Sanctuary exhibition and City Hall with guided tours, conversation, dinner, art-making and a projection show on the northside of City Hall facing Broad Street.

Guided tours will be led by Artistic Director Suzanne Seesman and Community Liaison Yaroub Al-Obaidi. A shared meal will take place in the Caucus Room of City Hall on the 4th floor to meet project artists and collaborators. Limited public tickets available.  

The evening will culminate with art-making and a projected movie of images, words, phrases that have come up throughout the project around the resettlement process - safety, sanctuary, place, and home - created by the [Illuminators](http://theilluminator.org/), an art-activist collective.
“The collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public spaces, transforming the street from a space of passive consumption and transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Our work calls attention to the many urgent crises that confront us, in support of the ongoing struggle for a more just, peaceful and sustainable world.”

This event is created in a way to invite audience to join where they can.

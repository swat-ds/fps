State violence takes many forms—family separation, criminalization, surveillance, and the control of bodies. How can we build an intersectional analysis that addresses these connections between incarceration, immigrant detention, homophobia, and the global refugee crisis? Hear from panelists about their lived experiences and their work in countering state violence that results in similar outcomes—family separation, criminalization, and surveillance. 


The talk will be followed by a simple bookmaking workshop that will weave contemporary experiences and archival materials to collaboratively explore, rewrite, and reclaim narratives of humanity that combat negative stereotypes. Participants can choose for their books to become part of the Swarthmore College Archives, possibly in the [Peace Collection](https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/),the largest archive of the peace movement in the United States, or Friends Historical Library.

Enjoy food made by Syrian Chef and Project Collaborator, Asmaa Diab.


Organized in partnership with [Asian Arts Initative](http://asianartsinitiative.org/), this is an official event that is part of this year’s partnering between The [Office of Immigrant Affairs](https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-immigrant-affairs/) and the [Office of LGBT Affairs](https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-lgbt-affairs/) for [Immigrant Heritage Month](https://www.phila.gov/spotlight/immigrant-heritage-month/) and [Pride Month](http://www.phillygaypride.org/) to ["explore intersectionality and highlight the diversity and depth of Philadelphia’s immigrant and LGBTQ communities, while also engaging broader audiences—regardless of how they identify."](https://www.phila.gov/2019-05-24-immigrant-heritage-month-and-pride-month-focus-on-intersectionality/)

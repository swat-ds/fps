Join _Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary_ for the First Friday Opening Reception of _Friends_. Experience everything from sculptures and dictionaries to archaeology books and paintings that celebrate and enumerate cultural and historical moments, conversations, personal stories, and most of all, friendships.

Hear the stories behind the works form Artistic Director, Suzanne L. Seesman, enjoy original poetry from project collaborators, and witness a performance by Erik Ruin and Julius Masri celebrating the past two years of the Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary project. 

_Friends_ will be on-display until Thursday, August 15th. Special thanks to our partners at 12Gates Arts for opening their space to our exhibition and don’t forget to witness our other two exhibitions, “Peace” and “Sanctuary” at the Free Library of Philadelphia & Art in City Hall.

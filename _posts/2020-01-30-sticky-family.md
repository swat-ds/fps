_Sticky Family_ is a story that emerged from a [series of creative workshops](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/workshops/sticky-family-with-yaroub-al-obaidi-josh-graupera/) that took place at Swarthmore College in Fall 2018. These workshops were co-facilitated by Philly-based artist and activist [josh graupera](http://www.joshgraupera.com/) and project community liaison and artist [Yaroub Al-Obaidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaroub-al-obaidi-224195167). A group of 20 participants—Swarthmore faculty and staff; students in a related Peace and Conflict Studies course taught by project directors Katie Price and Peggy Seiden; and collaborators on the Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary (FPS) project—told personal stories, created dynamic characters and stitched together a small mythos that resulted in the _Sticky Family_ narrative.

Yaroub and josh guided participants through fun exercises that lent to talking about real, honest, and difficult topics. Participants created individual superheroes and in groups combined characteristics into new characters and created a story with those combined characters. josh took the superheroes and storylines made in the workshops to create the comic script and layout for the book. This made it possible for Philly-based illustrator, Eric Battle to transform the script into a comic book and bring the characters to life.

The zines of the characters made during the workshops, as well as large-scale printed pages of the comic are available for display.

The artists are interested in continuing to develop more volumes of _Sticky Family_ through collaborative workshops with other communities and institutions. Reach out directly to the artists to find out how.

_Sticky Family_ was made possible by a generous grant from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://www.swarthmore.edu/presidents-office/mellon-grant-arts-and-humanities). Major support for Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary has been provided by [The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage](https://www.pewcenterarts.org/), with additional support from the [Cooper Foundation](https://www.swarthmore.edu/cooper-series), the Mellon Foundation, [Swarthmore College Libraries](https://www.swarthmore.edu/libraries), and the [Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility](https://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center/).

[Interview with Maureen Cummins](https://justicepracticebooks.omeka.net/exhibits/show/interviews/maureen_cummins)

> "I learned a lot about invisible violence hearing these stories. The US is often seen as heroic for taking in refugees, but my impression from interviewing the resettlers is that it’s more much about creating the next underclass. The refugees who are “allowed” in are in debt the second they get off the plane. Everything that’s paid for them to resettle here is simply a loan."

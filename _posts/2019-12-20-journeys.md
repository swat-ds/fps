**## Journeys**

_Journeys_ are a series of accordion books that were made during [workshops with Erik Ruin](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/workshops/journeys-artist-workshops-with-erik-ruin/)in early 2018. Each person learned how to tell a narrative using the accordion book style, paper cutting technique, and screen-printing. The books were screen printed at [Second State Press](www.secondstatepress.org) in Philadelphia, PA.

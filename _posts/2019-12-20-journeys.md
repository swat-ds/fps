_Journeys_ are a series of accordion books that were made during [workshops with Erik Ruin](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/workshops/journeys-artist-workshops-with-erik-ruin/) in early 2018. Each person learned how to tell a narrative using the accordion book style, paper cutting technique, and screen-printing. The books were screen printed at [Second State Press](www.secondstatepress.org) in Philadelphia, PA.  They were displayed in the exhibitions of the project at [Swarthmore College](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:swarthmore/swarthmore/), [Parkway Central Free Library of Philadelphia](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:free%20library/peace/), and [Booklyn](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:booklyn/september-27-october-26-2019/), as well as part of other programming at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-goat-penn-law-haaga-lounge/more-than-beyond-the-refugee-stereotype/608307969597427/), [College Book Arts Association](https://www.collegebookart.org/2020-New-Orleans), [NYC Book and Ephemera Fair](https://www.bookandpaperfairs.com/nyc-book-and-ephemera-fair), and [Millersville University](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-ware-center-arts-at-millersville-university/share-the-wealthraising-the-bar-for-local-arts/2616120131954777/).

On November 19, 2017 Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary Staff and Book Artists welcomed prospective artistic collaborators, members of Philadelphia's communities who have resettled to the region from Syria and Iraq, and visitors to Philadelphia Assembled for a meet and greet to launch Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary. In the Philadelphia Assembled Exhibition space of The Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Perelman Building, guests met project Book Artists Islam Aly, Maureen Cummins, Erik Ruin, and Mark and Courtney of the People’s Paper Co-Op and celebrated the launch of the project. Project Directors Peggy Seiden and Katie Price, along with project staff Nora Elmarzouky, Yaroub Al-Obaidi, and Suzanne Seesman introduced the project to the public on Philadelphia Assembled’s Paul Robeson stage. The celebration concluded with a shared meal. Guests and visitors enjoyed food from Manakeesh Bakery and Cafe in the Philadelphia Assembled Kitchen.

Friends, Peace & Sanctuary welcomes friends and family members of all ages to experience the people, food, and art at the heart of the project during the exhibition’s opening weekend at Swarthmore College! 

This Community Celebration offers you the chance to experience a taste of the project for yourself. 

You will get to sample Syrian and Iraqi food, learn more about partner organizations, and participate in a variety of art demonstrations. These include: letterpress with Maureen Cummins, laser cutting with Islam Aly, papermaking with Mark Strandquist and Courtney Bowles, and silk-screening with Second State Press—all techniques used by book artists and Syrian and Iraqi collaborators to produce the works on view in the exhibitions.

Closing out the Community Celebration will be the premiere of Erik Ruin’s musical collaboration with Julius Al-Masry, a companion to his artists’ book. You won’t want to miss this multisensory performance. 

This all-day community event celebrates two years of community collaboration that has led to the current Friends, Peace & Sanctuary exhibition. Experience these works from now until the end of April before an expanded exhibition moves to Center City in Summer 2019.

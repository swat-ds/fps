Did you miss the _Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary_ exhibition at Swarthmore College in April? 

Experience an expanded, multi-site exhibition that delves deeper into three concepts of human connection at the heart of the project—friends, peace, and sanctuary—and their ability to create a sense of belonging and empathy. 

Works by resettled Syrians and Iraqis of the Philadelphia community and renowned book artists interweave historical and contemporary narratives, feelings, and experiences of refuge. 


## **June-August 2019 in Center City Philadelphia**

Each site will be focused around different themes and goals of the project that tie together as one exhibit. Click on the exhibition title for more details and programming information.

On display at [12Gates Arts](http://www.twelvegatesarts.org/) from June 7 to August 15, 2019

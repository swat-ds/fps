**عرس اللاجئ: الخوف الخفي**
{: .ar}


Altered wedding dress and digitally printed silk with images and articles

I am here starting a new life.
If you look at me you will see me smile. You will see me laugh. You will see me look fine
But the fear is always inside of me.
What I saw in the war, in my home will never be erased or fixed.
These are the images and the words burned into my memory.
They will always be inside of me.

**عرس اللاجئ: الخوف الخفي**

<br/>Altered wedding dress and digitally printed silk
<br/>Asmaa Diab, Nora Elmarzouky
<br/>2018-2019


<hr/>


<br/>I am here starting a new life.
<br/>If you look at me you will see me smile. You will see me laugh. You will see me look fine
<br/>But the fear is always inside of me.
<br/>What I saw in the war, in my home will never be erased or fixed.
<br/>These are the images and the words burned into my memory.
<br/>They will always be inside of me.

This piece was imagined and stitched together by Asmaa Diab. She asked other collaborators to share photos or articles that reflect the depression and destruction in Syria. The images and articles were collaged together and printed on silk that Asmaa sewed underneath the first layer of the wedding dress. This was installed in the [_Sanctuary_ exhibit on the 4th floor of Philadelphia City Hall](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:city%20hall/sanctuary/) in Summer 2019 and [_Collaborative Works on Paper_](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:booklyn/september-27-october-26-2019/) at Booklyn.

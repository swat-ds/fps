Join _Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary_ for a day filled with culinary + art workshops connected to the two-year project at The Free Library of Philadelphia. Experience the _Peace_ exhibition with guided tours from Artistic Director, Suzanne Seesman. This is one of three sites that make up the full exhibition that showcases newly created and collaborative artworks by resettled Syrians and Iraqis & renowned book artists that interweave historic and contemporary stories of refuge. 

Spend the day at the beautiful Parkway Central Branch whether that’s in the [Culinary Literacy Center](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/programs/culinary/) or the newly renovated [Heim Center for Cultural and Civic Engagement](https://libwww.freelibrary.org/blog/post/3712).

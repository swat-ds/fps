<br/>Paint on canvas
<br/>Mohamed Okab
<br/>2018-2019


<hr/>


Painting was a hobby of Mohamed's more than thirty years ago that he set aside because it was not an economic pathway that he could take care of his family with. Participating in this project reunited Mohamed with his love for painting. He started and continues to take painting and other art classes at [Fleisher Art Memorial](https://fleisher.org/take-a-class/classes/). These 4 paintings reflect the diversity of Iraqi women and their experiences in contrast to the single-narrative that is often portrayed in the media. This was displayed as part of the [_Friends_ exhibit at Twelve Gates Arts](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:twelve%20gates/friends/) in Summer 2019.

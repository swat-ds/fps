<br/>Fadaa Ali and Amaal Al-Najjar
<br/>2019


<hr/>

This sculpture represents the story of Amaal's crossing the border from Syria into Turkey illegally with her husband. They had to travel in the middle of the night with a group of other people and their smugglers. Much of their journey was in the middle of the night to avoid any Syrian security or other militias. Once they reached the border, they had to cross a 5 meter ditch with a rope and her husband got stuck. Even though she was battling cancer at the time, she managed to help her husband get out with the help of Turks who were on the other side. Fadaa had been experimenting with plaster and decided she wanted to tell Amaal's story through sculpture. The piece is accompanied with a recording of Amaal telling her story in Arabic with English translation. It was exhibited in the [_Friends_ exhibit at Twelve Gates Arts](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:twelve%20gates/friends/) and [_Collaborative Works on Paper_](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:booklyn/september-27-october-26-2019/) at Booklyn.

_Alternative Structures_ was a series of books that were made during [workshops with Islam Aly](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/workshops/alternative-structures-artist-workshops-with-islam-aly/) in 2018. Each person learned how to make various forms of books and how to use a book to tell multiple narratives, including [dos-Ã -dos binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dos-%C3%A0-dos_binding), exploring the connections between the book form and it's content.

The final workshop was held at [Fleisher Art Memorial](https://fleisher.org/) in Philadelphia, PA.  These works were displayed in the exhibitions of the project at [Swarthmore College](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:swarthmore/swarthmore/), [Parkway Central Free Library of Philadelphia](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:free%20library/peace/), [Twelve Gates Arts](http://www.twelvegatesarts.org/) and [Booklyn](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/exhibitions/exhibit:booklyn/september-27-october-26-2019/). Some were also displayed as part of other programming at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-goat-penn-law-haaga-lounge/more-than-beyond-the-refugee-stereotype/608307969597427/), [College Book Arts Association](https://www.collegebookart.org/2020-New-Orleans), [NYC Book and Ephemera Fair](https://www.bookandpaperfairs.com/nyc-book-and-ephemera-fair), and [Millersville University](https://www.facebook.com/events/the-ware-center-arts-at-millersville-university/share-the-wealthraising-the-bar-for-local-arts/2616120131954777/).

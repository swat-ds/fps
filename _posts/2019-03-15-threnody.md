***A Threnody for the Dispossessed*** is a sixty-foot long screen-printed scroll/accordion-book that impressionistically interweaves the experiences of people displaced by war in the Middle East, Europe and Latin America. Images and experiences flow freely into another, the trails of tear gas morphing into the mists of limbo. A "wailing ode", a chorus of voices drawn from historical accounts and contemporary interviews accompanies the book, part of an original score  by multi-instrumentalist Julius Masri. This piece can be viewed in the [Rare Books Collection](https://www.swarthmore.edu/libraries/rare-book-room) in McCabe Library at Swarthmore College. The remaining copies are available for purchase through [Booklyn](https://booklyn.org/archive/index.php/Detail/Object/Index/object_id/2238).

His music focuses on improvisatory methods and syncretic/linguistic exchanges within various musical languages including Jazz, Metal, Afro-Cuban, Experimental Noise, and Arabic music. Born in Tripoli, Lebanon, he moved to the States in 1990 and picked up drumming a year later. He studied with Philadelphia instructors Carl Mottola, Elaine Hoffman-Watts, and as an undergraduate at Bard College, with AACM's Thurman Barker, Richard Teitelbaum, and Joan Tower. Julius plays drums, circuit modified Casio keyboards, Oud, Kamancheh (aka Rabab, Spike Fiddle), and various other instruments. He currently performs in groups such as grind/crust metal band Night Raids, free jazz groups Sirius Juju and Dromedaries, experimental rock band Van Sutra, trombone and synth duo Superlith, and more.

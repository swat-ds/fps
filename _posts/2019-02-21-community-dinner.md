You are invited to celebrate the culmination of this two-year project at our exhibition opening and communal dinner to become part of the Friends, Peace & Sanctuary conversation.

Join us for the premier exhibition of artists books from world renowned book artists Islam Aly, Maureen Cummins, Erik Ruin, Courtney Bowles and Mark Strandquist that weave archival research of refugee and migrant experiences with contemporary Syrian and Iraqi narratives of resettlement to Philadelphia. Their works will be exhibited alongside works by Syrian and Iraqi project collaborators that were produced throughout a series of workshops led by the artists, as well as archival materials related to displacement from Swarthmore College’s Friends Historical Library and Peace Collection.

After experiencing the exhibition, meet all collaborators, commissioned artists, and project team members who made this project possible at the communal dinner catered by @Aria Mediterranean Cuisine. Expect delicious food and stimulating conversation as we continue to build community together.

To join us at the (free) community dinner, held at Swarthmore College's Clothier Hall, [please RSVP](https://bit.ly/FPSDinner).

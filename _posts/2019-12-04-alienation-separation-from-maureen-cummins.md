_**AlieNation / SepaRation**_ contains text from a series of interviews that [Cummins](http://www.maureencummins.com/) conducted with ten collaborators on the FPS project. Cummins designed the book to give the reader a visceral sense of separation. While interacting with the book, readers experience how frustrating it can be when even the most ordinary tasks and routines, such as reading a book, become a challenge. Cummins hopes that the experience of the reader/viewer is in part one of dislocation, alienation, and separation and that this experience opens an empathetic space for reading the accounts shared by the individuals she interviewed.

Coptic-bound books, silkscreen-printed on Arches Cover.

_**AlieNation / SepaRation**_ contains text from a series of interviews that [Cummins](http://www.maureencummins.com/) conducted with four families who collaborated on the FPS project. She selected and collaged 48 excerpts to create the narrative arc. Cummins designed the book to give the reader a visceral sense of separation. While interacting with the book, readers experience how frustrating it can be when even the most ordinary tasks and routines, such as reading a book, become a challenge. Cummins hopes that the experience of the reader/viewer is in part one of dislocation, alienation, and separation and that this experience opens an empathetic space for reading the accounts shared by the individuals she interviewed.
> The making of AlieNation / SepaRation spanned over a year and a half of work in five different locations: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Women’s Studio Workshop in Rosendale, New York; Penland School of Arts in Penland, North Carolina; One Cottage Street in Easthampton, Massachusetts, and the artist’s own studio in Mt. Tremper, New York. During Phase One of the printing stage, deeply saturated flats of color were hand-squeegeed onto blank sheets of Arches Cover White. Blocks of text were then surprinted over these color fields, a challenging process that required masterful registration. The edition was bound by Lisa Hersey in the Coptic style, a structure that draws directly upon an early Middle Eastern binding tradition. Each set of four books is housed in a handsome plexiglass slipcase fabricated by SmallCorps, with laser-etched titling by Sarah Pike.

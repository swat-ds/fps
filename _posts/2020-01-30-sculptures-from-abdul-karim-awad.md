Inspired to change the narrative around Iraqi people and culture, Abdul Karim used his art and calligraphy skills to create many different types of artwork including these sculptures. This was his first time to create these types of works. In addition to being exhibited at either City Hall or 12 Gates, many of these works were also exhibited at [Oxford Circle's Christian Community Development Association's The Exchange](http://occcda.org/) during Northeast Restaurant Week.

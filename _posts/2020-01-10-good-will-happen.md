**Good Will Happen** is a chapbook with different types of poetry created during a series of [poetry workshops](http://fps.swarthmore.edu/workshops/five-sense-home-erasure-poetry-with-maryan-captan/) led by [Maryan Captan](https://thebodyinparts.tumblr.com/). It was published in 2019 by [Head and the Hand Press](https://www.theheadandthehand.com/) and printed at [Fireball Printing](https://fireballprinting.com/). This collection of poems was written by Ali Salman, Amaal Al-Najjar, Fouad Sakhnini, Fadaa Ali, Abdul Karim Awad, Osama Herkal, Layla Al-Husseini, and Raghad Samir. Maryan led collaborators in activating archives in the contemporary by creating "found poetry."  She also led an exploration of the five senses and home. The chapbook can be viewed in person at Swarthmore College Library.

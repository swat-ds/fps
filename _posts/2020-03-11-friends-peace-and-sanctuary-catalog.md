Artistic Curator, Suzanne Seesman, worked closely with designers [GDLOFT](https://www.gdloft.com/) to create a catalog that reflected the processes and goals of the project. Filled with images from the project, this catalog is a toolkit for replicating such a project. It is a completely bi-lingual catalog that can open from the left to read in English and open from the right to read in Arabic.  The catalog features essays from the project team, as well as external contributors such as [Hammam Aldouri](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/aldouri-hammam), [Islam Aly](https://www.islamaly.com/), and [Marshall Weber](https://booklyn.org/archive/index.php/Detail/Entity/Show/entity_id/792).  It was translated by five refugees across the world through [NaTakallam](https://natakallam.com/), a company that offers award-winning, high-quality language learning programs delivered by refugees, for all levels of Arabic, French, Persian and Spanish, as well as professional translation services to individuals and organizations worldwide. 

GDLOFT states: 
> "The book structure attempts to reflect issues of displacement and immigration by melding two books (stories) into one. The book(s) shares a common cover while housing two book blocks... the design attempts to express the experience of finding commonalities and differences akin to the refugee experience through design and layout."

If you did not get a catalog during exhibitions programming, they are available [for sale through Booklyn](https://shop.booklyn.org/product/friends-peace-and-sanctuary/).

***Yes To Hope*** is a collective book made by Abdul Karim Awad, AJ, Ali Salman, Asmaa Diab, Abir Al-Arnab, Fadaa Ali, Layla Al-Husseini, Mohamed Okab, Fouad Sakhnini, Osama Herkal, Raghad Alkhafaji, Roula Al-Jabi, Amaal Al-Najjar, and Shatha during [Maureen Cummins'](http://www.maureencummins.com/) artist workshops in early 2018. Each person had a 2-page spread to design based loosely around the theme home. They wrote recipes, important quotations, family trees, poems, songs and other stories related to home and incorporated hand drawn images or photos. The title was collectively selected through voting on the various suggestions put forward.  In the third workshop at [Second State Press](http://www.secondstatepress.org/) in Philadelphia, PA, Maureen demonstrated how to do a simple book stitch and how to use the letter press and each person printed their own cover and bound their own book to take home.

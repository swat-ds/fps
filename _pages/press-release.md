**August 27, 2019 (Brooklyn, NY)** — Booklyn is proud to present a selection of collaborative works on paper and textile produced by staff and participants of Swarthmore College’s Friends, Peace and Sanctury project (http://fps.swarthmore.edu/).  

First conceived of in 2016 by Peggy Seiden, (College Librarian for Swarthmore College) and Katie Price, (Associate Director, Lang Center for Civic & Social Responsibility) the FPS project was designed to bring American and Egyptian artists and culture workers together to collaborate with members of the Syrian and Iraqi refugee communities of Philadelphia. 

Using the Swarthmore College Peace (https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/) archive as a primary resource for intersectional research the FPS program included: intensive workshops for participants focused on producing artists’ books and publications; cultural sensitivity training for all artists and staff, and outreach goals that resulted in numerous collaborations with Philadelphia cultural and refugee service organizations.  FPS produced dozens of events, exhibitions, workshops, an outstanding and comprehensive project catalog and hundreds of artworks and publications.

The passionate organizing by Yaroub Al Obaidi, (FPS Community Liaison), Nora Elmarzouky, (FPS Project Manager) and Suzanne L. Seesman, (FPS Artistic Director) in collaboration with all the participants catalyzed an ongoing creative community amongst the participants and an exemplary social practice model of critical engagement. The urgent relevance and generosity of FPS programming are evident in its courageous examination of resettled Iraqi and Syrian experiences and the myriad human rights and cultural appreciation issues revealed by the sharing of these diverse experiences. 

With work by: Abir AlArnab, Layla Al-husseini, Fadaa Ali, Islam Aly, Roula Aljabi, Samah Alkasab, Amaal Alnajjar, Yaroub Al-Obaidi, Nora Elmarzouky, Fadia, Osama Herkal, Abdul Karim Awad, Eric Battle, Courtney Bowles, Maureen Cummins, Asmaa Diab, Josh Graupera, Marwa, Mohamed Okab, Hassan Muhtadi, Raghad Samir, Erik Ruin, Ali Salman, Fouad Sakhnini, Suzanne Seesman, Shouq Ramadan, and Mark Strandquist.

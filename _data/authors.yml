I have a garden in my backyard where I can grow foods that remind me of home. I miss my children who are spread out.  My son is in Turkey and my daughters are in Germany, Austria, and Syria. From all our heart we hope for peace to come to our country again and we can go back to live together again with my family. The days spent with the artists and new friends have been so nice. We have learned a lot from them and hope to keep working with them. We would love to thank all of you for your kind and dealing professionally with us.”

    Asmaa is a collaborator on this project from Syria. She is an artist with many talents who went to an arts high school in Syria. When she got married to her husband in Syria, they bought a home right in front of her family's house. They share fond memories of the sounds of their canaries that filled their home as they watered the many plants and living surrounded by friends and family. Their home was destroyed and looted and they were forced to move around Syria many times. Asmaa, her husband, and their three sons were able to go to Egypt with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. She hasn’t seen her home since. Before receiving refugee status to come to the US, she waited in Egypt for 3 years. She was happy to at least be living near her sister’s family and also was able to work from home using her sewing skills. Now she has been in the US for almost 3 years. Her sister’s family is still waiting in Egypt to hear about where they may be resettled and the rest of her family is still in Syria. The transition in the US has not been easy. Asmaa misses her family and her home deeply, while working everyday to rebuild her life in the US. She uses her creativity to make tapestries and accessorizes textiles for dresses, pillows, and more. Asmaa loves to share her culture through the food she cooks. She is phenomenal cook who offers catering for events.

    Mark Strandquist and Courtney Bowles have spent years using art as a vehicle for connecting diverse communities to amplify, celebrate, and power social justice movements. Their projects combine organizing strategies and urgently needed services, with collaborative, poetic, and performative actions that connect diverse and often antagonistic actors (abolitionists, police departments, service providers, and those impacted by the criminal justice system) to not only imagine more just and beautiful worlds, but to try and build them. They have received multiple awards, fellowships, national residencies, and reached wide audiences through *The NY Times*, *NPR*, *The Guardian*, *The Washington Post*, *PBS NewsHour*, and *VICE*. Their work has been exhibited at Project Row Houses, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Virginia Museum of Fine Art, and galleries across the country. Their work has been seen and engaged by tens of thousands of people through exhibits in legal clinics, parades, church basements, conferences, state legislatures, and many other non-traditional art spaces. They currently direct the People’s Paper Co-op in Philadelphia, PA, the Performing Statistics project in Richmond, VA and In 2017, building on a fellowship from A Blade of Grass, they received the Open Societies Moving Walls grant to expand the ongoing project, The Reentry Think Tank.

    Fadia is a collaborator on this project. “I am a Syrian citizen. I come from a country like a paradise that I love so much. I grew up and spent the most beautiful years there. Suddenly, without notice and in the darkness of night, the war started to knock on my country’s doors. These were difficult and nerve-wrecking days that we went through. After that I had no choice but to flee from Syria to our neighboring country, Jordan, to try to seek sanctuary for my family and I. It was a difficult journey and felt like the worst days, especially when my husband died, but I believe that is what Allah wants. I came to the USA with some of my kids, but a part of my heart is still there… Too far from me… My oldest son is still in Jordan with his kids. They were approved to come to the US right after we did, but they stopped letting Syrians come, so they are waiting. I hope one day I can see them. I feel homesick. I also feel like an outsider, but there are many nice people I have met who have helped me not feel like an outsider. I continue to do my hobbies - crochet, knitting, and making other handcrafted clothes and accessories.”

    Osama is a collaborator on this project. In his own words: "I am Osama. I was born in the city of jasmine. Its name is Damascus. I studied there and worked in the catering department at Damascus Airport. In 2011 our revolution started to seek freedom against the Fascist regime. I was arrested because I joined the demonstrations and they put me in the darkness of jail. After I was released I found my country destroyed by the regime. In 2013, I moved to Egypt - a country I love. I lived there for 3 years waiting to hear where my family and I would be resettled. I worked in cooking, sewing, and advertisement. My family’s case was approved by the US Authorities in 2016. Now we live in quiet and peace. I miss to see my mother and brothers who still live in Syria. This is just shortened version of my long story that contains hard and dark nights. It contains the displacement of my family and loss of my past life. I am now living in this country and it’s like a kind mother to me. Thanks to everyone who has helped me and my family to come live peacefully here. Participating in this project gave me the opportunity to show the skills and for the other peoples that the war made them flee.

    Fadaa Ali is a collaborator on this project. In her own words: "An American woman of Iraqi origin, since my childhood I have an art talent, but I haven’t had a chance to develop it. My studies were far from art, where I studied to be a pharmacy technician when I came to America. Luckily I had the opportunity to work in art in Philadelphia with Penn Museum and Radio Silence with Mural Arts Project. I have the talents to work with antiques and integrate colors to give a different scenery."

    Mohamed is a collaborator on this project. He was born in a city south of Iraq in 1953. He attended high school in Baghdad and continued on to a technical institute in 1974, but did not work in the field he studied. Instead he worked a variety of jobs freelance, one of them as a book seller on Almutanabi Street, known as the Street of Culture in Baghdad. He enjoys reading and drawing. Mohamed, his wife, and children came to the United States as refugees in 2013 due to violence and confusion of the situation in Iraq. He is now living in the City of Philadelphia and has since returned to his favorite hobby of drawing, citing his involvement in the Friends, Peace, and Sanctuary project as the impetus: “I wish I can draw some of the history from this great country and to draw some important interesting places to visit."

    Osama is a collaborator on this project. In his own words: "I am Osama. I was born in the city of jasmine. Its name is Damascus. I studied there and worked in the catering department at Damascus Airport. In 2011 our revolution started to seek freedom against the Fascist regime. I was arrested because I joined the demonstrations and they put me in the darkness of jail. After I was released I found my country destroyed by the regime. In 2013, I moved to Egypt - a country I love. I lived there for 3 years waiting to hear where my family and I would be resettled. I worked in cooking, sewing, and advertisement. My family’s case was approved by the US Authorities in 2016. Now we live in quiet and peace. I miss to see my mother and brothers who still live in Syria. This is just shortened version of my long story that contains hard and dark nights. It contains the displacement of my family and loss of my past life. I am now living in this country and it’s like a kind mother to me. Thanks to everyone who has helped me and my family to come live peacefully here. Participating in this project gave me the opportunity to show the skills and for the other peoples that the war made them flee.
